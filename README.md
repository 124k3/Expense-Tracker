## Usage

1. Compile the program.
2. Run the compiled Java file.
3. Follow the prompts to enter data for monthly expenses or debt transactions.
4. The program will save the data to CSV files: `expense_data.csv` for monthly expenses and `debt_data.csv` for debt transactions.

## File Structure

- `ItemProperties`: Defines the properties of items, including constructors for different scenarios.
- `FileHandler`: Manages file operations, such as writing and appending data to CSV files.
- `MonthlyExpense`: Main class containing the program logic and user interactions.
